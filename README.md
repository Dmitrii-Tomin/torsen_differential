## Introduction

This project features a 3D printed model of a **Torsen differential**, a type of **limited-slip differential** used in automotive applications to improve traction. The model is designed for **educational purposes**, allowing enthusiasts and students to **explore the mechanics and functionality** of a Torsen differential through a hands-on approach.

## Components

The project includes the following components:

- **1 Main Housing:** The outer casing of the differential with the big bevel gear.
- **1 End Cap:** Secure the assembly and provide structural support.
- **2 Sun Gears:** Two central gears that connect to the drive shafts.
- **6 Planet Gears:** Multiple small worm gears with spur gears at each end that distribute torque between the sun gears.
- **1 Bevel Gear:** transports the torque to the differential.
- **1 Stand:** Holds the whole assembly.
- **1 Stopper:** Holds the bevel gear in place.
- **2 Wheels:** (optional) to stop the output shafts.
-
- **3 608 bearings:** 8x22x7 mm.
- **3 M4 bolts:** 15-40 mm in length (recomended flat head screw minimum 20mm in leangth).
- **12 M5 bolts:** 20 mm in leangth (I used one 20mm screw and one 25mm screw for each planet gear).
- **7 M3 nuts**
- **7 M3 grub screws:** recomended at least 6mm, smaller ones might fall out.
- **3 Aluminium rods:** 8 mm in diameter. 85, 75 and 93 mm in leangth (doesn't really matter, but by using this dimentions they will have the perfect leangth and stick out equally)

## Requirements

- **3D Printer:** Capable of printing the required components.
- **Filament:** PLA, ABS, or any preferred filament material.
- **Lubricant:** Essential, because of the tight tolerances. Without it the operation wont be smooth (I just used WD-40).
- **Assembly Tools:** Basic tools such as screwdrivers and sandpaper.
- **3D Modeling Software:** (Optional) For modifying the original design files.

## Installation

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Download from Printables or the `torsen_differential_parts` ZIP file.
     ```sh
     https://www.printables.com/model/926631-torsen-differentixal-limited-slip-differential
     ```

2. **Prepare for Printing:**
   - Open the `.stl` or `.3mf` files in your preferred slicing software.
   - Adjust print settings according to your printer and filament specifications IMPORTANT.

3. **Print the Components:**
   - Print all the parts individually. Ensure each part is printed accurately for proper assembly.
   - ***IMPORTANT:*** First print a couple of parts to ensure proper tolerances and adjust the horizontal expansion.
     This was printed on an old printer, so the fit might be too loose.

4. **Assemble the Model:**
   - Follow the assembly instructions provided in the `torsen_differential_assembly_guide.pdf` included in the repository.

5. **Modify:**
   - If you want to modify something you can download the `torsen_differential_fusion.f3d` file and do your modifications in Fusion.
